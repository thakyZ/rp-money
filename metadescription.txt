^#EA9931;Roleplay money for your buying needs.^#FFFFFF;

Adds RP money.
Acts like voxels but with no loss, and looks like coins.
Idea taken from Terraria, with copper, silver, gold, and platinum coins.
Craft the table at the basic inventors table.
No need for a item list, this is meant to be used without cheating.
